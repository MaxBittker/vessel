life in a bottle, pixel style! 

the idea for this project is a self-contained ecosystem, simulated with a cellular automata style engine. hopefully all entities following simple rules such as conservation of energy a circular lifecycle will result in a system that exhibits pleasant dynamic equilibrium. 

inspirations: 
    -falling sand games
    -conway's game of life 
    -self contained ecosystems  
    -proteus 
    -darwin pond
